Heyyyy,

I hope you are doing well.

Steps for starting the project:

1. Cloning the project on your device
2. Opening it with the Visual Studio 2019
3. Using Microsoft SQL 2018 for database migrations

Click "Debug" on your top-bar in Visual Studio and than "Start without debuging".

By clicking right click on the project and choosing "Set startup project" you can choose which one part of application you have to use.

That is all you need to start my project.

I hope you will enjoy in using my project.
Abedin
